Self-modifying packer for Javascript PC Emulator (http://bellard.org/jslinux/).

Usage is simple:
	1) Download "jpb.sh" (or "loader.sh", then skip step 2).
	2) Run "sh jpb.sh save loader.sh".
	3) Open "loader.sh" in you favorite text editor and copy/paste code to 
	   Bellards emulator.
	4) Wait for boot, then run "sh /dev/clipboard". This will install new 
	   command to your emulated system - "jpb".
	5) Run "jpb" for help. Create some files, add them with "jpb add filename".
	6) Run "jpb save" and save code from clipboard field.
	7) Refresh page (reboot emulated pc), copy saved code to clipboard field, 
	   run "sh /dev/clipboard".
	8) Your files are alive :)
